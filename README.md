# San Francisco Food Trucks data

This repositiory contains a command-line python program that prints out list of open food trucks in the city of San Francisco. The program queries the Mobile Food Schedule API to get food truck data. The specifications for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/WaleedSehgal/Redfin_challenge/blob/master/Redfin%20Take%20Home%20Prompt.pdf).

## Prerequisites

Make sure you full fill the following requirements, to run the program.

* The minimum python version required to run this program is python 3.5.2. If you have already installed python, check your python version by running the following command in your terminal.

    ```
    python --version
    ```

    If you do not have python installed, download and install the latest python version from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)


* Install the following three required libraries using [**pip**](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/), the de facto python package installer:
    
    * Install the [**requests**](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) library to make HTTP requests to external APIs. Run the following command in the terminal to install requests.
        ```
        pip install request
        ```

    * Install the **pandas** library to create data frames, for more information on pandas, see [pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/). Run the following command in the terminal to install pandas.
        ```
        pip install pandas
        ```
    
    * Install the [**tabulate**](https://pypi.org/project/tabulate/) library to tabulate data. Run the following command in the terminal to install tabulate.
        ```
        pip install tabulate
        ```
    
    
    >**Note:**
    >If you are calling this API within an application and feel like your application might make API requests quite extensively, please follow the instuctions in the [Mobile Food Schedule API documentation](https://dev.socrata.com/docs/app-tokens.html) to get an application token. The API requests that can be made without using an application token are limited. Request with application tokens have a higher limit, but might be throtteled if abused.

## Run the program

To run this program from a command-line terminal follow the steps below:

1. [Clone](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) this repository from github.

2. Navigate to the repository folder in your terminal.

3. Run the program using the following command:

    ```
    python show_open_food_trucks.py
    ```

    On a successful execution, the program will display maximum 10 results at a time, sorted alphabatically by truck name. It will prompt you to input 'y' to view next results or 'n' to quit.

## Final thoughts

My thought process for the solution, has been to segregate classes and functions so that they follow the Single responsibility principle of the SOLID OOP design principle. I have used the Socrata API **SoQL** query language to query the data along with the request. I believe the functionality to go back and display previous results could have been implemented, but I tried to stick with the spec. and asked the user wether to display the next 10 results only.
